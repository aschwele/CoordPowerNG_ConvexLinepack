# Online Appendix: Coordination of Power and Natural Gas Systems: Convexification Approaches for Linepack Modeling

Electronic companion for the research paper "Coordination of Power and Natural Gas Systems: Convexification Approaches for Linepack Modeling"
This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper "Coordination of Power and Natural Gas Systems: Convexification Approaches for Linepack Modeling". 
This is joint work by Anna Schwele, Christos Ordoudis, Jalal Kazempour and Pierre Pinson.

In this repository, we provide:
   1. The source code implemented in Python using Gurobi.
   2. The xlsx file that containts the data of the case study.
